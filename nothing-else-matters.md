Nothing Else Matters can also be interpreted similarly to The Unforgiven.

I never opened myself this way

_Never let them play..._

The meaning is sometimes between the verses, wink, wink:

```
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
```

```
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
```

```
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah!
```
